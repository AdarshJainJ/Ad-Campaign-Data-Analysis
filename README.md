# Ad-Campaign-Data-Analysis

Project Objective:

This project focuses on analyzing advertising campaign data to extract key performance indicators (KPIs) and derive actionable insights. The analysis was performed using SQL to efficiently query large datasets, followed by domain-specific interpretations to better understand the campaign performance.

Key Features of the Analysis:

Data Analysis: Utilized SQL to compute essential KPIs such as impressions, clicks, cost per click (CPC), click-through rate (CTR), and conversions.

Insights Generation: Interpreted KPI metrics in the context of campaign objectives to identify trends, areas of improvement, and optimization opportunities.

Domain Knowledge Application: Applied expertise in the digital advertising ecosystem to make meaningful recommendations based on campaign performance data.

Techniques & Skills Demonstrated:

Writing efficient SQL queries to fetch and process KPI data.
Using aggregate functions, Group by & Order by functions to filter data.
Interpreting data trends to align with business goals and enhance campaign outcomes.
This project highlights the ability to leverage technical skills in SQL and combine them with domain expertise to drive data-driven decisions in the digital advertising industry.

Description & Use case of the KPIs calculated:

1. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):
   
Description: CAC measures the cost of acquiring a new customer, calculated by dividing total marketing and sales expenses by the number of new customers acquired in a period.

Use: Helps businesses evaluate the efficiency of their marketing efforts and ensure they’re acquiring customers at a sustainable cost.

2. Return On Ad Spent (ROAS):

Description: Marketing ROI assesses the profitability of marketing campaigns, calculated as the net revenue generated from marketing efforts divided by the total marketing expenses.

Use: Determines the effectiveness of marketing strategies in generating returns and guides budget allocation for future campaigns.

3. Click-Through Rate (CTR):
   
Description: CTR measures the percentage of users who click on a digital ad or link out of the total who view it, calculated as (Clicks ÷ Impressions) × 100.

Use: Indicates the effectiveness of online advertising and content engagement, helping optimize campaigns.

4. Cost Per Click (CPC):
   
Description: CPC measures the cost incurred for each click on a digital ad, calculated as Total Ad Spend ÷ Total Clicks.

Use: Helps businesses monitor and control spending on digital advertising while maintaining profitability.

5. Cost Per Lead (CPL):
   
Description: CPL calculates the cost of acquiring a new lead, determined by dividing marketing expenses by the number of leads generated.

Use: Evaluates the efficiency of lead-generation efforts and ensures campaigns are targeting valuable prospects.

6. Revenue Per Click (RPC):
   
Description: RPC measures the revenue generated for each click on an ad or digital link, calculated as Total Revenue ÷ Total Clicks.

Use: Gauges the profitability of paid digital campaigns and helps optimize targeting and bidding strategies.

7. Average Order Value (AOV):
   
Description: AOV calculates the average amount spent per order, determined by dividing total revenue by the total number of orders.

Use: Provides insights into customer spending habits and informs strategies to increase order sizes, like bundling or upselling.

8. Cost Per Mile (CPM):

Description: CPM measures the cost incurred for each 1000 Impressions on a digital ad, calculated as (Total Ad Spend ÷ Total Impressions) * 1000.

Use: Helps businesses monitor and control spending on digital advertising while maintaining profitability.
